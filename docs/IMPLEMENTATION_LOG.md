### Planned Implementation Order
1. **Setup Phase** ✓
   - Create sync files ✓
   - Initialize git repository ✓

   - Validate booking rate matches theoretical expectations ✓
   - Test edge cases (empty market, single shift) ✓
   - Check output data structure and consistency ✓

4. **Stage 2 Planning** ✅

   - Specify enhanced data collection requirements ✓
   - Plan Jupyter notebook demos ✓

## Implementation Notes

### CODER Implementation Decisions
- Used dataclasses for clean entity structure (Shift, Nurse, BookingEvent, SimulationResult)
- Implemented position-weighted multinomial logit as specified
- Added comprehensive validation in SimConfig class
- Created separate modules for clean separation of concerns:
  - config.py: Configuration and validation
  - entities.py: Data structures and basic methods  
  - mechanics.py: Core choice algorithms
  - discrete.py: Main simulation loop
- Included BookingEvent tracking for detailed analysis
- Added both unit tests and integration tests

### Design Decisions
- Using simple discrete time steps (t = 1, 2, 3...)
- Position weights: [1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2] as specified in guide
- Default parameters: λ=0.5, μ=1.0, k=5, n_shifts=20
- Treatment ranking: treated shifts sort first, then by utility (descending)
- Poisson arrivals instead of strict Bernoulli for more realistic modeling

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow the writing style from CLAUDE.md (simple, direct language)
- Use clear variable names
- Add docstrings for all functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where helpful

### Technical Approach
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Random module for stochastic processes
- Dataclasses for clean entity definitions
- Simple configuration via function parameters

## Deviations from Plan
- Used Poisson arrivals instead of strict Bernoulli for more realistic modeling
- Enhanced entity classes with additional methods (is_available, book_shift, check_reopening)
- Added BookingEvent and SimulationResult classes for better data tracking

## Questions/Issues
None - implementation completed successfully and tested.

## Next Actions
**Current**: Hand off to REVIEWER agent for Stage 2 validation.

### Stage 2 Implementation Completed (CODER):
1. ✅ Enhanced entities.py with SimulationState class
2. ✅ Modified discrete.py to add run_simulation_with_tracking()
3. ✅ Created comprehensive plots.py module
4. ✅ Built interactive Jupyter notebooks (01_basic_sim.ipynb, 02_visualize.ipynb)
5. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for visualizations (test_stage2.py)

### Implementation Summary:
- **SimulationState class**: Captures timestep, shift statuses, availability counts
- **Enhanced tracking**: run_simulation_with_tracking() returns result, states, shifts
- **Visualization functions**: 
  - plot_availability_heatmap(): Shows filled/open patterns over time
  - plot_booking_timeline(): Scatter plot of bookings by treatment status
  - plot_running_booking_rates(): Rolling window booking rates
  - create_summary_dashboard(): 2x2 comprehensive view
- **Analysis functions**:
  - calculate_shift_utilization(): Per-shift booking rates
  - identify_interference_patterns(): Automated interference detection
- **Interactive notebooks**: Full demos with parameter exploration
- **Test validation**: 11/11 tests passed, performance <0.2s per visualization

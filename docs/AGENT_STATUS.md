## Stage Progress
### Stage 1: Basic Discrete-Time Model
- [x] Setup sync files
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Define initial specifications
- [ ] Finalize implementation plan
- [ ] Implement core classes
- [ ] Implement choice model
- [ ] Implement simulation loop
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Review and validate

## Communication Log
**14:30** - SETUP: Created initial sync files and project structure. Ready to hand off to PLANNER for spec finalization.

**14:45** - PLANNER: Enhanced Stage 1 specifications with:
- Detailed algorithmic implementations for choice model
- Specific function signatures and responsibilities  
- Comprehensive testing requirements including unit and integration tests
- Clear output data structure requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for implementation

**15:00** - CODER: Completed Stage 1 implementation with:
- config.py: SimConfig dataclass with validation
- entities.py: Shift, Nurse, BookingEvent, SimulationResult classes
- mechanics.py: Complete choice model algorithms  
- discrete.py: Main simulation loop with CLI interface
- tests/test_stage1.py: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- All functionality tested and working correctly
- Ready to hand off to REVIEWER for validation

**15:30** - REVIEWER: Completed comprehensive Stage 1 validation:
- ✅ All requirements compliance verified
- ✅ Code quality assessment: EXCELLENT
- ✅ All unit and integration tests pass
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly
- ✅ Output data structure correct and consistent
- ✅ Performance acceptable for Stage 1
- **FINAL RESULT: STAGE 1 APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**
- Ready to hand off to PLANNER for Stage 2 design

**15:45** - PLANNER: Completed Stage 2 visualization system specifications:
- ✅ Defined three core visualizations (availability heatmap, booking timeline, running rates)
- ✅ Specified enhanced data collection with SimulationState tracking
- ✅ Designed comprehensive plots.py module structure
- ✅ Planned interactive Jupyter notebook demos
- ✅ Defined clear success criteria and validation requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for Stage 2 implementation

**16:30** - CODER: Completed Stage 2 visualization system implementation:
- ✅ Enhanced entities.py with SimulationState class for timestep tracking
- ✅ Enhanced discrete.py with run_simulation_with_tracking() function
- ✅ Created comprehensive plots.py module with all visualization functions:
  * plot_availability_heatmap(): Shows shift filled/open patterns over time
  * plot_booking_timeline(): Scatter plot of bookings colored by treatment
  * plot_running_booking_rates(): Rolling window rates for treated vs control
  * create_summary_dashboard(): 2x2 comprehensive visualization dashboard
- ✅ Created analysis functions: calculate_shift_utilization(), identify_interference_patterns()
- ✅ Built interactive Jupyter notebooks (01_basic_sim.ipynb, 02_visualize.ipynb)
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (test_stage2.py) with 11/11 tests passing
- ✅ Performance validated: All visualizations render in <0.2 seconds
- Ready to hand off to REVIEWER for Stage 2 validation

## Notes
Multi-agent workflow is now operational. Each agent should:
1. Update this file when taking over
2. Document their completed work
3. Clearly specify what the next agent should do
4. Flag any blocking issues or questions

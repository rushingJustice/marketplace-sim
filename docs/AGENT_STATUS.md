# Agent Status - Marketplace Simulation Project

## Current Agent Information
**Active Agent**: REVIEWER  
**Stage**: 1 - Basic Discrete-Time Model  
**Phase**: Implementation Validation  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-23 at 15:30

## Current Status
Reviewing and validating Stage 1 implementation against specifications and requirements.

## Last Completed Action
- CODER completed: Full Stage 1 implementation with comprehensive testing
- Created all required modules (config.py, entities.py, mechanics.py, discrete.py)
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Code pushed to GitHub repository: https://github.com/rushingJustice/marketplace-sim

## Next Required Action
**Hand off to**: PLANNER  
**Task**: Design Stage 2 specifications (visualization system)  
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes  
**Dependencies**: Stage 1 approval completed

## Blocking Issues
None currently.

## GitHub Information
**Repository Status**: Not yet initialized  
**Current Branch**: N/A  
**Related PRs**: None  
**Open Issues**: None

## Agent Handoff Queue
1. **SETUP** → **PLANNER**: Finalize Stage 1 specs ← **CURRENT**
2. **PLANNER** → **CODER**: Implement Stage 1 code
3. **CODER** → **REVIEWER**: Review and validate implementation
4. **REVIEWER** → **PLANNER**: Plan Stage 2 or iterate Stage 1

## Stage Progress
### Stage 1: Basic Discrete-Time Model
- [x] Setup sync files
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Define initial specifications
- [ ] Finalize implementation plan
- [ ] Implement core classes
- [ ] Implement choice model
- [ ] Implement simulation loop
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Review and validate

## Communication Log
**14:30** - SETUP: Created initial sync files and project structure. Ready to hand off to PLANNER for spec finalization.

**14:45** - PLANNER: Enhanced Stage 1 specifications with:
- Detailed algorithmic implementations for choice model
- Specific function signatures and responsibilities  
- Comprehensive testing requirements including unit and integration tests
- Clear output data structure requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for implementation

**15:00** - CODER: Completed Stage 1 implementation with:
- config.py: SimConfig dataclass with validation
- entities.py: Shift, Nurse, BookingEvent, SimulationResult classes
- mechanics.py: Complete choice model algorithms  
- discrete.py: Main simulation loop with CLI interface
- tests/test_stage1.py: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- All functionality tested and working correctly
- Ready to hand off to REVIEWER for validation

**15:30** - REVIEWER: Completed comprehensive Stage 1 validation:
- ✅ All requirements compliance verified
- ✅ Code quality assessment: EXCELLENT
- ✅ All unit and integration tests pass
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly
- ✅ Output data structure correct and consistent
- ✅ Performance acceptable for Stage 1
- **FINAL RESULT: STAGE 1 APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**
- Ready to hand off to PLANNER for Stage 2 design

## Notes
Multi-agent workflow is now operational. Each agent should:
1. Update this file when taking over
2. Document their completed work
3. Clearly specify what the next agent should do
4. Flag any blocking issues or questions

# Agent Status - Marketplace Simulation Project

## Current Agent Information
**Active Agent**: PLANNER  
**Stage**: 1 - Basic Discrete-Time Model  
**Phase**: Specification Finalization  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-23 at 14:45

## Current Status
Reviewing and finalizing Stage 1 implementation specifications for marketplace simulation.

## Last Completed Action
- SETUP completed: Git repository initialized with full sync system
- Created requirements.txt, setup.py, and .gitignore  
- Made initial commit with all synchronization files
- Project structure ready for development

## Next Required Action
**Hand off to**: CODER  
**Task**: Implement Stage 1 core functionality  
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes  
**Dependencies**: None

## Blocking Issues
None currently.

## GitHub Information
**Repository Status**: Not yet initialized  
**Current Branch**: N/A  
**Related PRs**: None  
**Open Issues**: None

## Agent Handoff Queue
1. **SETUP** → **PLANNER**: Finalize Stage 1 specs ← **CURRENT**
2. **PLANNER** → **CODER**: Implement Stage 1 code
3. **CODER** → **REVIEWER**: Review and validate implementation
4. **REVIEWER** → **PLANNER**: Plan Stage 2 or iterate Stage 1

## Stage Progress
### Stage 1: Basic Discrete-Time Model
- [x] Setup sync files
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Define initial specifications
- [ ] Finalize implementation plan
- [ ] Implement core classes
- [ ] Implement choice model
- [ ] Implement simulation loop
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Review and validate

## Communication Log
**14:30** - SETUP: Created initial sync files and project structure. Ready to hand off to PLANNER for spec finalization.

**14:45** - PLANNER: Enhanced Stage 1 specifications with:
- Detailed algorithmic implementations for choice model
- Specific function signatures and responsibilities  
- Comprehensive testing requirements including unit and integration tests
- Clear output data structure requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for implementation

## Notes
Multi-agent workflow is now operational. Each agent should:
1. Update this file when taking over
2. Document their completed work
3. Clearly specify what the next agent should do
4. Flag any blocking issues or questions

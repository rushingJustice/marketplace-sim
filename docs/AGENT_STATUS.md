## Agent Handoff Queue
1. **SETUP** → **PLANNER**: Finalize Stage 1 specs ← **CURRENT**
2. **PLANNER** → **CODER**: Implement Stage 1 code
3. **CODER** → **REVIEWER**: Review and validate implementation
4. **REVIEWER** → **PLANNER**: Plan Stage 2 or iterate Stage 1

## Stage Progress
### Stage 1: Basic Discrete-Time Model
- [x] Setup sync files
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Define initial specifications
- [ ] Finalize implementation plan
- [ ] Implement core classes
- [ ] Implement choice model
- [ ] Implement simulation loop
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Review and validate

## Communication Log
**14:30** - SETUP: Created initial sync files and project structure. Ready to hand off to PLANNER for spec finalization.

**14:45** - PLANNER: Enhanced Stage 1 specifications with:
- Detailed algorithmic implementations for choice model
- Specific function signatures and responsibilities  
- Comprehensive testing requirements including unit and integration tests
- Clear output data structure requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for implementation

**15:00** - CODER: Completed Stage 1 implementation with:
- config.py: SimConfig dataclass with validation
- entities.py: Shift, Nurse, BookingEvent, SimulationResult classes
- mechanics.py: Complete choice model algorithms  
- discrete.py: Main simulation loop with CLI interface
- tests/test_stage1.py: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- All functionality tested and working correctly
- Ready to hand off to REVIEWER for validation

**15:30** - REVIEWER: Completed comprehensive Stage 1 validation:
- ✅ All requirements compliance verified
- ✅ Code quality assessment: EXCELLENT
- ✅ All unit and integration tests pass
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly
- ✅ Output data structure correct and consistent
- ✅ Performance acceptable for Stage 1
- **FINAL RESULT: STAGE 1 APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**
- Ready to hand off to PLANNER for Stage 2 design

**15:45** - PLANNER: Completed Stage 2 visualization system specifications:
- ✅ Defined three core visualizations (availability heatmap, booking timeline, running rates)
- ✅ Specified enhanced data collection with SimulationState tracking
- ✅ Designed comprehensive plots.py module structure
- ✅ Planned interactive Jupyter notebook demos
- ✅ Defined clear success criteria and validation requirements
- Ready to hand off to CODER for Stage 2 implementation

## Notes
Multi-agent workflow is now operational. Each agent should:
1. Update this file when taking over
2. Document their completed work
3. Clearly specify what the next agent should do
4. Flag any blocking issues or questions

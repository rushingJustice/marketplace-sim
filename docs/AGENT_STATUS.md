## Current Status
Setting up multi-agent synchronization system with GitHub integration.

## Last Completed Action
- Created synchronization file structure
- Defined PROJECT_PLAN.md with detailed Stage 1 specifications
- Set up IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md and REVIEW_LOG.md templates
- Created basic project directory structure

## Next Required Action
**Hand off to**: PLANNER  
**Task**: Review and finalize Stage 1 specifications  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes  
**Dependencies**: None

## Blocking Issues
None currently.

## GitHub Information
**Repository Status**: Not yet initialized

**Related PRs**: None  
**Open Issues**: None

## Agent Handoff Queue
1. **SETUP** → **PLANNER**: Finalize Stage 1 specs ← **CURRENT**
2. **PLANNER** → **CODER**: Implement Stage 1 code
3. **CODER** → **REVIEWER**: Review and validate implementation
4. **REVIEWER** → **PLANNER**: Plan Stage 2 or iterate Stage 1

## Stage Progress
### Stage 1: Basic Discrete-Time Model
- [x] Setup sync files
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Define initial specifications
- [ ] Finalize implementation plan
- [ ] Implement core classes
- [ ] Implement choice model
- [ ] Implement simulation loop
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Review and validate

## Communication Log
**14:30** - SETUP: Created initial sync files and project structure. Ready to hand off to PLANNER for spec finalization.

## Notes
Multi-agent workflow is now operational. Each agent should:
1. Update this file when taking over
2. Document their completed work
3. Clearly specify what the next agent should do
4. Flag any blocking issues or questions
